The Stopwatch GUI window will appear on your screen. The window has several sections:

"Notes:" label and a text box below it where you can take notes during timing.
"Stopwatch: 00:00:00" label, which displays the elapsed time of the stopwatch in hours, minutes, and seconds.
"Set Time: (HH:MM:SS)" label and an entry field below it where you can set a time limit for the stopwatch.
"Set Time" button, which sets the time limit based on the value entered in the entry field.
"Copy Notes to Clipboard" button, which copies all the notes to the clipboard.
Click the "Set Time" button and enter the desired time in the format of "HH:MM:SS" (hours:minutes:seconds) in the entry field.

Click the "Pause" button to pause the stopwatch at any time. The button will change to "Resume". Click it again to resume timing.

If you want to take notes during timing, enter the note in the entry field at the bottom and press Enter.
The note will be added to the notes list displayed in the "Notes:" text box.

To copy all the notes to the clipboard, click the "Copy Notes to Clipboard" button.
The notes will be copied to the clipboard, in chronological order from earliest to latest per time,
and can be pasted into any other application.
